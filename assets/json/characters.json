After a traumatic childhood incident where his powers first manifested, he lived for decades as a wandering warrior, soldier, and adventurer. During World War II, he was captured by the Canadian government's Weapon X program, which bonded the indestructible metal Adamantium to his skeleton. With his memories erased and turned into a living weapon, Wolverine eventually broke free and began a long journey of rediscovery. His gruff exterior hides a complex moral code and fierce loyalty to those he cares about. As a member of the X-Men and occasional Avenger, his centuries of combat experience and unbreakable determination make him one of the world's most formidable fighters.",
